Preregistration training aims to help researchers make their results more transparent and trustworthy by clearly differentiating pre-planned from exploratory analyses.

This training will teach researchers to:
* preregister studies 
* identify **what type of studies** preregistration is most valuable for
* choose an appropriate preregistration **template**
* **find repositories**


_Preregistration training introduces you to the fundamentals of preregistration and
provides you with practical tools for preregistering real studies. It also acts as a
platform for further self-directed learning.
